Online Experience 
=================

Mattermost, Inc. is an online experience company that makes open source, enterprise software. Being an online experience company means we do the vast majority of our internal collaboration in the online experience we develop--specifically a Mattermost instance at `https://pre-release.mattermost.com <https://pre-release.mattermost.com>`_--rather than in-person. 

Mattermost, Inc. was founded in 2015 from SpinPunch, Inc., an online experience company developing a cross-platform HTML5 video game engine to rival Adobe Flash. While the technology was not successful (couldn't achieve needed performance on Android), the focus on online experience formed the foundation of Mattermost's culture and competitive advantage in entering the enterprise collaboration market through an community-driven commercial open source business model.
