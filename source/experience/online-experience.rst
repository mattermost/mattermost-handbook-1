Online Experience 
=================

Mattermost, Inc. is an online experience company that makes open source, enterprise software. We do the vast majority of our internal collaboration in the online experience we develop--specifically the work-in-progress Mattermost instance at `https://pre-release.mattermost.com <https://pre-release.mattermost.com>`_--rather than in-person, and we have only a small number of staff in online 

Mattermost, Inc. was founded in 2015 from SpinPunch, Inc., an online experience company developing a cross-platform HTML5 video game engine to rival Adobe Flash. While the technology was not successful (couldn't achieve needed performance on Android), the focus on online experience formed the foundation of Mattermost's culture and competitive advantage in entering the enterprise collaboration market through an community-driven commercial open source business model.
