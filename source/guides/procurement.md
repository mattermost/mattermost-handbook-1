### How to procure consulting services on a standard agreement (1-2 business days)

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then:

3. You should get an email back from procurement team with proposed SOW language to approve or discuss prior to sending it to the vendor for e-sign 
4. After you've approved the SOW procurement sends e-sign to vendor to complete. 

After contract is complete, MBO receives invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future. 

### How to procure consulting services on a non-standard agreement (1-3 weeks)

If your vendor wants to use a non-standard agreement, email the agreement to `procurement@mattermost.com` to have reviewed. The process may take 1 to 3 weeks given legal review time needed. 

### How to procure software subscription services (1-3 weeks) 

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then:
