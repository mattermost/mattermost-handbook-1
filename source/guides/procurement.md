# How to procure at Mattermost 

## IMPORTANT: Mattermost runs its own e-sign process

DO NOT have vendors send e-sign to Mattermost staff. Mattermost needs all e-sign to be setup using Mattermost e-sign systems by the following people: 

- PeopleOps and Consulting Agreements (HelloSign) - Jen Shepard 
- Customer and Partner Agreements (DocuSign) - Melissa Warner 
- Subscription Software Services (DocuSign) - Camille Harris 

The e-signed documents are organized and archived based on e-sign manager. 

If a vendor needs to use e-sign through their system an exception can be made via written agreement by Mattermost CEO. 

## Functional DRI guide to procurement 

If you own a process that has budget approved for a new system or services agreement you're a "Functional DRI" (Directly Responsible Individual). Here's how you can procure:  

### How to procure software subscription services (3-5 business days) 

1. Check [existing systems list](https://airtable.com/shrwSRirvgm3Ayg31/tblI4gu3oPUiZazs8?blocks=hide
) to confirm the system isn't purchased already. 
2. Confirm with finance (Aneal Vallurupalli) you have budget for the spend
3. Email `procurement@mattermost.com` with enough details of your purchase so that: 
     - (If applicable) They can contact the sales person you're working with
     - They can run a legal and privacy policy review for EU-U.S. Privacy Shield compliance 
     - After review is complete, they can run the terms acceptance or e-sign process
     - The NAME and PURPOSE of the system can be updated in our [Systems List](https://airtable.com/shrwSRirvgm3Ayg31/tblI4gu3oPUiZazs8?blocks=hide) 
4. The procurement team will complete the appropriate reviews and run either the credit card setup or e-sign, add you as the business administrator and fill in the appropriate information in the Systems List. 

IMPORTANT: 
- Mattermost runs its own e-sign process. 
- **DO NOT have vendor send e-sign to us, it will be automatically routed to trash.**

If the service is purchased via invoices (instead of billed via Credit Card), you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future. 

### How to procure consulting services on a standard agreement (1-2 business days)

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then: 

1. Email vendor [link to explain how Mattermost procures consulting services](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.cw54xe8enb2k). 
2. Agree on the SOW section with the vendor and email the [completed SOW table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#) to procurement@mattermost.com with "Procurement Request: [VENDOR_NAME]" in the subject. 
3. You should get an email back from procurement team with proposed SOW language to approve or discuss prior to sending it to the vendor for e-sign 
4. After you've approved the SOW procurement sends e-sign to vendor to complete. 

After contract is complete, you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future. 

### How to procure consulting services on a non-standard agreement (1-3 weeks) 

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then: 

If your vendor wants to use a non-standard agreement, email the agreement to `procurement@mattermost.com` to have reviewed. The process may take 1 to 3 weeks given legal review time needed. 

After contract is complete, you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future.
