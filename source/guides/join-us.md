## FAQ 

### Do you offer internships? 

We don't currently offer internships. If you're interested in expanding your experiences and resume, please consider joining our open source community: https://mattermost.com/contribute/

### I'm interested in a staff position, how do I get noticed? 

If you haven't yet experienced the product, you should do that as a first step. Join our testing server at https://pre-release.mattermost.com

When you apply there's a question about your experience with Mattermost and at a minimum you should have spent some time using the product and have some opinions on what we might improve. 

We hire about 70% of our R&D staff from our open source community. If you want to increase your odds further, please consider trying a beginner or intermediate open source contribution via https://mattermost.com/contribute/

### I'm an agency or contingent recruiter and I have a candidate for you 

Thank you for thinking of us. In general, we don't work with agency or contingent recruiters unless they are referred from people we know who can vouch for success in working with you. 

Unless you fit this criteria, we would ask you remove us from your mailing list.
