# Leadership Meetings 

## Daily Heads-Up 

Objectives: 

- Avoid administrative pings throughout the day (get them done here) 
- Avoid blindspots in leadership team (share "heads-up" on what others need to know) 

Time: 

- Daily weekday meeting from 8:31am to 8:41am Palo Alto time
- Meeting starts on-time, ideally ends before end time 

Process

- Each person gives 30-60s on what they're working on and what's needed from others
- Optional: `/standup` command can be used to share FYIs to team on what you're working on.
- Meeting is over at 8:41am and 19 minutes after can be used for catch-ups.
