This handbook is a guide to serving on the core team of the Mattermost open source project, which includes making contributions both as a volunteer contributor from the community and as a paid staff member of Mattermost, Inc. 

We're in the process of migrating and developing material for this handbook which was previously in the product documentation: https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#

**Credits:** Our culture and process draws from the work of `Wordpress <https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/>`_, `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/source/handbook>`_, `Pixar <https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012>`_ and `Intel <https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481613210&sr=1-1&keywords=high+output+management>`_ in different ways.
