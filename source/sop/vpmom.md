# VPMOM 

VPMOM is an exercise in awareness. When correctly implemented it results in total alignment across organizations while executing at high speed. VPMOM (pronounced "Vee Pea Mom") is an acronym for vision, priorities, methods, obstacles, and measures and is expressed as a one-page document outlining:  

Vision: 

- One sentence definition of what we want to do 

Priorities: 

- List of the most important parts of the vision in priority order 

Methods: 

- List of what's needed from everyone to get the job done 

Obstacles: 

- List of key challenges to be overcome to achieve our vision 

Measures: 

- List of desired results, often numerical 

# VPMOM Template

The following template is used to lock annual VPMOMs in one page. Anything that doesn't fit on one page should be added to the "Commentary" section at the end of the one page VPMOM. 

``` 
# [TITLE] VPMOM Plan ([INITIALS OF DRI])

Vision
- [Define what you want to do in one sentence] 

Priorities 
- [What are the relative priorities of the elements of your vision?]

Methods
- [What are the steps and actions everyone needs to take?]
- [Include hiring and on-boarding if you plan to increase headcount] 

Obstacles 
- [What are the key challenges to be overcome to meet vision? (typically outside your control)] 

Measures 
- [What are the actual results we want to deliver? (typically numbers)]

[Commentary on anything RAPID should know that doesn't fit within the one-page V2MOM structure.]

```

VPMOMs are based off of [V2MOMs created in 1999 by Marc Benioff](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html) to align the efforts at Salesforce.com. We use VPMOMs instead of V2MOMs for a number of reasons, including 1) VPMOMs use the label "Priorities" rather than "Values" to more clearly differentiate the Priorities of a specific VPMOM from core values of a company, 2) "V2MOMs" have been inconsistently implemented and blogged about, which creates confusion when new hires try to learn more about how to implement them correctly. VPMOMs enable Mattermost to consistently apply its specific implementation of V2MOM.
