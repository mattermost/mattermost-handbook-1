## Policies 

Venue
- Venue should not have any additional surcharge for bringing our own photography or video vendors.

Activities Vendors 
- Vendors for activities (such as boat party, snorkeling, guided tours, etc.) should not ever make a MatterCon attendee feel overly pressured to participate in any activity. For example, on a party boat, participants should never be coerced to dance or drink alcohol, only offered. Managers and colleagues who sense coercion should ask the vendor to stop immediately.
