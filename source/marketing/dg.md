More detail to come on rules of engagement. 

### Lead Status
When a lead comes into Salesforce, it progresses through the lead statuses defined below:
* **New** New new lead record, not enough activity to be considered an MQL.
* **MQL** A Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) is a lead that has reached a lead scoring threshold (100 points). Lead scoring model is based on firmographic, demographic, and behavioral information and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMF7ppWS_Naf-kIFgRymLWwHRVkB09VTqB7wv-AXOnM/edit#gid=0) (internal doc).
* **Accepted** Lead owner has accepted the lead and will work to qualify. *This will remove from marketing nurture.*
* **Qualifying** Lead owner is engaged in 2-way conversation with the lead.
* **Qualified** Lead owner has uncovered and recorded in Salesforce the required sales accepted (SAO) or sales qualified lead (SQL) criteria. Lead has committed to a defined next step. 
* **Nurture** Lead is not currently engaged or interested. Lead owner should have enough information to understand why putting into nurture. Lead owner should set a task to re-engage at a defined time. *This will send back to marketing to be nutured.*
* **Unqualified** Lead is not interested or does not meet SQL criteria. Lead owner should have enough information to understand why marketing unqualified. 
* **Bad Data** Lead contact information is incorrect or invalid. Lead owner has checked to ensure there are no typos.
