## E-sign Archive 

All e-signed documents from Feb 1, 2019 onward should be filed in the folder [2019_data_room_CONFIDENTIAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sE23XufwhsNt8WFlCmkbuCjZaKbelj9jxqoq9ZTN7Wc/edit). 

### File Archive Naming Convention 

- All files should be renamed `[FINAL_SIGNATURE_DATE]_[ENTITY_NAME]_[AGREEMENT_TYPE]` all in lowercase with underscores for spaces (`[FINAL_SIGNATURE_DATE]` format is `yyyymmdd`)
- All files should be filed in TRIPLICATE by date, entity and agreement type 
  - `by_date` - Add file to this folder and it should auto-organize based on date pre-fix of file name. 
  - `by_entity` - Add file to `[ENTITY_NAME]` folder, or create a new folder if one doesn't exist. 
  - `by_type` - Add file to existing folder with `[AGREEMENT_TYPE]`

Example: 

For a vendor agreement signed on January 22, 2019 with ABC Company, Inc.: 

1. Name the file `20190122_abc_company_inc_vendor_agreement` 
2. Copy and paste it three places in the archive: 
  - `by_date/20190122_abc_company_inc_vendor_agreement`
  - `by_entity/abc_company_inc/20190122_abc_company_inc_vendor_agreement`
  - `by_type/vendor_agreement/20190122_abc_company_inc_vendor_agreement`

The purpose of this system is to optimize for the following: 

1. Fast look-up - By providing three of the most common ways to find files, in addition to search. 
2. Resiliency - Using folders instead of tags allows us to switch file storage systems without losing data. 
3. Security - Folder structure provides appropriate permissions for the right people to store and access documents.
