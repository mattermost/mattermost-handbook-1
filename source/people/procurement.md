# How to procure at Mattermost 

## IMPORTANT: Mattermost runs its own e-sign process

DO NOT have vendors send e-sign to Mattermost staff. Mattermost needs all e-sign to be setup using Mattermost e-sign systems by the following people: 

- PeopleOps and Consulting Agreements (HelloSign) - Jen Shepard with a copy to Lisa McCaffrey 
- Customer and Partner Agreements (DocuSign) - Melissa Warner 
- Subscription Software Services (DocuSign) - Camille Harris 

The e-signed documents are organized and archived based on e-sign manager. 

If a vendor needs to use e-sign through their system an exception can be made via written agreement by Mattermost CEO. 

## Functional DRI guide to procurement 

If you own a process that has budget approved for a new system or services agreement you're a "Functional DRI" (Directly Responsible Individual). Here's how you can procure:  

### How to procure software subscription services (3-5 business days) 

1. Check [existing systems list](https://airtable.com/shrwSRirvgm3Ayg31/tblI4gu3oPUiZazs8?blocks=hide
) to confirm the system isn't purchased already. 
2. Confirm with finance (Aneal Vallurupalli) you have budget for the spend
3. Email `procurement@mattermost.com` with enough details of your purchase so that: 
     - (If applicable) They can contact the sales person you're working with
     - They can run a legal and privacy policy review for EU-U.S. Privacy Shield compliance 
     - After review is complete, they can run the terms acceptance or e-sign process
     - The NAME and PURPOSE of the system can be updated in our [Systems List](https://airtable.com/shrwSRirvgm3Ayg31/tblI4gu3oPUiZazs8?blocks=hide) 
4. The procurement team will complete the appropriate reviews and run either the credit card setup or e-sign, add you as the business administrator and fill in the appropriate information in the Systems List. 

IMPORTANT: 
- Mattermost runs its own e-sign process. 
- **DO NOT have vendor send e-sign to us, it will be automatically routed to trash.**

If the service is purchased via invoices (instead of billed via Credit Card), you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future. 

### How to procure consulting services on a standard agreement (1-2 business days)

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then: 

1. Email vendor [link to explain how Mattermost procures consulting services](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.cw54xe8enb2k). 
2. Agree on the SOW section with the vendor and email the [completed SOW table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#) to procurement@mattermost.com with "Procurement Request: [VENDOR_NAME]" in the subject. 
3. You should get an email back from procurement team with proposed SOW language to approve or discuss prior to sending it to the vendor for e-sign 
4. After you've approved the SOW procurement sends e-sign to vendor to complete. 

After contract is complete, you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future. 

### How to procure consulting services on a non-standard agreement (1-3 weeks) 

Confirm with finance you have budget for the spend, then: 

If your vendor wants to use a non-standard agreement, email the agreement to `procurement@mattermost.com` to have reviewed. The process may take 1 to 3 weeks given legal review time needed. 

After contract is complete, you'll get an invite to Bill.com to approve invoices from vendor submitted in future.

### Procuring agency recruiting 

**Please discuss with Lisa McCaffrey & agree prior to engagement and signing any agreements**

Our intent is to substanially move away from agencies. - Please partner with your recruiter and Lisa McCaffrey.

For non-VP roles: 

1. Agency recruiters for non-VP roles can only be hired at market terms: non-exclusive contingent fee of 20% of first-year base compensation, 1-year non-poach, and 90-day replacement. 
2. Once agency agreement is reviewed by legal, e-sign should be managed by Mattermost through standard process (see above). Per company policy, agency should not send their own e-sign.
3. Upon successful start of new hire, invoice should be sent to `payments@mattermost.com`.

For VP roles, Mattermost can enter into retained searches, but not at levels lower than VP. 

## Request for Proposals (RFP) Process

Any purchase over $100,000 USD in product or services should go through an RFP process and recieve at least three quotations before making a decision. 

1. Write a paragraph on what you need. 
2. Send the paragraph to at least three vendors who provide services, and obtain proposals and quotations 
3. Choose the best vendor based on anticipated quality and price
