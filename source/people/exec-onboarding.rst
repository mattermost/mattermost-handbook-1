Executive Onboarding 
====================

For new executives joining the team, there is a high ROI for providing time for the leader to learn about the company and build relationships ahead of taking action. 

Day 1-7 - Learning 
----------------------------
- Exec drafts plan and works with CEO to edit it in the first week 
- Joins leadership team meetings 
- Extra CEO 1-1 time (first 8 weeks)  
  - 25m Monday and Friday meetings with CEO to mindmeld (cancel at exec's discretion) 
  - Meetings cover company pitch, recruiting story, what's sacred and other topics 
  - Gives opportunity for exec to dig in and find the "why" behind decisions  
- Exec may start with no directs and inherit them later after a plan is developed for each role   

Day 1-30 - Planning 
----------------------------
- Understand the company and the team 
- Go through onboarding materials 
- Go deeper into the product 
- Build relationships and understanding with leadership team and broader team 

Day 31-60 - Starting to execute 
----------------------------
- Develop concrete plans 

Day 61-90 
----------------------------
- Start to see evidence of execution 

Notes: 
----------------------------
- Outside of a few exceptions, if onboarding has been done properly and an executive isn't working well with the rest of the team at 60 days, things are unlikely to significantly improve.
