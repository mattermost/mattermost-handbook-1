# Planning, Budgeting and Forecasting 

The following outlines the work-in-progress planning, budgeting and forecasting process at Mattermost. 

## Planning 

Mattermost uses a V2MOM process for planning it business annually and quarterly. Each section of the V2MOM serves a specific purpose: 

Vision 
- Concise and precise definition of what we’re out to achieve and how we’re going to get there at a high level

Values 
- These are prioritized criteria independent of methods that define how we’re going to make trade-offs. Example if we have “Technical Beauty” at the top of the list and “Customer Time-to-Value” as second, it means technical beauty is the second highest priority over everything else, but we’re okay sacrificing some amount in exchange for more getting customers successful more quickly. 

Methods & Measures 
- The programs, outcomes and single measure we’re going to use to achieve the vision. Each program should typically have one key measure precisely defined. Methods are what we resource against and budget for. 

Obstacles 
- These are the specific challenges we really, really worry about. As reviews happen and colleagues inevitably disagree, this is where we note concerns we all see in the plan, and we worry about them together and all the way through our success. These are challenges that should haunt until we have a plan to clear them out. 

V2MOM plans cascade across the company with methods of one V2MOM linking to the vision of lower level V2MOMs. Budget and performance assessment center about V2MOMs. 

## Budgeting 

Budget should be tied with Methods and Measures in departmental V2MOMs and be broken down by recurring costs (headcount and systems purchases, which are centrally managed) and non-recurring costs (vendor budget for the fiscal year managed by the department).  

Headcount (Count)

  - Role title
  - Level (associate, intermediate/manager, senior/senior manager, principal/director, staff/senior director)

## Forecasting and Reporting 

After budget approval, reporting on the results of investments and forecasting results of on-going investments happens via Monthly Business Reviews (MBRs) and Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs).
