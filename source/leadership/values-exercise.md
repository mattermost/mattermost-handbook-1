# Guide to Defining Company Values

### Definition

Values guide our thinking and decision-making from every day projects to long-term planning. When making decisions under complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity (CUA), we determine our point of view and actions through the lens of our principles.

### Principles

- Values should apply regardless of department
- Values should be displayed publicly and easily accessed
- Seeing the values in action is a way to keep the values alive and top of mind

### Process

1. Gather a diverse group of staff (6-8) from around the organization for a facilitated brainstorming session. These team members should represent what leadership believes are the values to which all staff should aspire. The facilitator can be an internal person or an external person. 

2. The facilitator should encourage the group to share stories of how they do their best work. The facilitator can guide the conversation and is encouraged to use visual aids (e.g. sticky notes or a shared document) to capture ideas.

3. Ideas are then grouped by theme. Themes are then refined in to words with at least high level definitions - e.g. how would these words/values show up in actions/behaviors at the company.

4. The facilitator then meets with the leadership team to walk them through the outcome of the session and share why they landed where they did. During this meeting, the leadership team can narrow the list, refine the list, and refine the definitions to be sure the result reflects anything the initial group may have missed. 

5. The group should take a few days to reflect on the final list for a few days and comes back to it with fresh eyes. The team should meet again to finalize the list of values.

6. The leadership team should present the full list of values to the team during the All-Hands meeting, then publish to the website.
