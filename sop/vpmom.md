# VPMOM 

VPMOM is an exercise in awareness. When correctly implemented it results in total alignment across organizations while executing at high speed. VPMOM (pronounced "Vee Pea Mom") is an acronym for vision, priorities, methods, obstacles, and measures and is expressed as a one-page document outlining:  

- Vision: One sentence definition of what we want to do 
- Priorities: List of the most important parts of the vision in priority order 
- Methods: List of what's needed from everyone to get the job done 
- Obstacles: List of key challenges to be overcome to achieve our vision 
- Measures: List of desired results, often numerical 

VPMOMs are based off of [V2MOMs created in 1999 by Marc Benioff](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html) to align the efforts at Salesforce.com. We use VPMOMs instead of V2MOMs for a number of reasons, including 1) VPMOMs use the label "Priorities" rather than "Values" to more clearly differentiate the Priorities of a specific VPMOM from core values of a company, 2) "V2MOMs" have been inconsistently implemented and blogged about, which creates confusion when new hires try to learn more about how to implement them correctly. VPMOMs enable Mattermost to consistently apply its specific implementation of V2MOM.
